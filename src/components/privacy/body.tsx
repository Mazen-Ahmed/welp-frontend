			<p>
				Information from other services, including social networks: You
				can connect your Welp profile with your social media profiles,

			<p>Name and/or username</p>
			<p>Email address</p>
			<p>Profile photo</p>

			<p>
				Before your request to connect your Welp profile with a social
				network profile is carried out, you’ll be told which information
				we will collect from that social network. You can disconnect
				your social network profile from your Welp profile via your Welp
				account at any time. Welp will then remove your social network
				unique ID, and disconnect/revoke Welp from your social network.
				However, your social network profile picture will remain on your
				Welp profile unless you change it and we will retain your name
				and email address.

				information, such as your interaction with our platform or
				marketing emails, such as by leaving reviews or posting replies
				to reviews.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes we’re given information about you from third parties.
				For example, when you sign up for a Welp account via Facebook,
				your account is automatically pre-filled with the information we
				receive from them. Similarly, when a business asks us to send a
				review invitation to you on their behalf, they give us your
				name, email address and a reference number, such as an order ID
				or similar.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also generate or collect information from your computer or
				device automatically as you use our services — like your IP

				If you’ve chosen to preserve anonymity by not using your name

			<p>Your personal data shared with data processors</p>
			<p>
				We share your personal data with selected third parties
				(including Welp subsidiaries and other companies within the Welp
				group, and companies we work with to provide our services) that
				provide us with a variety of different services that support the
				technical operation of our platform and the delivery of our
				services (“data processors”). These third parties are data
				processors for the personal data for which we are the data
				controller. We have data processing agreements in place with the
				data processors, and it follows from these agreements that they
				must act solely in accordance with our instructions. By
				accepting this policy, you authorize us to instruct the data
				processors to process data in accordance with this policy and
				for the purposes of using the platform.
			</p>
			<p className="my-3">
				We carry out checks to ensure that data processors have taken
				reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
				against the information being accidentally or illegally
				destroyed, becoming lost or deteriorating, and to protect
				against the information being disclosed to unauthorized persons,
				being misused, or in other ways being processed in violation of
				data protection laws.
			</p>
			<p className="my-3">
				Some of these data processors and third-party services will be
				located in countries outside of the one in which you are based
				and may have different, or less stringent, data protection
				standards. However, subject to the local laws in these
				countries, we will ensure that necessary safeguards are in place
				to protect your data, regardless of location. We do this through
				a combination of appropriate technical, organizational and
				administrative security measures, and by putting in place the
				necessary legal contracts to back up these requirements.
			</p>
			<p className="my-3">
				Other disclosures In addition to the above, we share your
				personal data with the following parties and in the following
				circumstances:

			</p>
			<p>How long do we store your personal data?</p>
			<p>
				We only keep your data for as long as we need it, or are
				required to for legal reasons. This depends on why it was
				collected, and if we have a continuing legal basis to do so
				(such as to fulfil a contract between us, perform a service you
				requested, meet legal requirements, or for our legitimate
				interests). When we no longer have a valid reason to keep your

				identify you. We treat data differently depending on what it’s
				used for, but you can delete your personal data or ask us to do
