				<p>
					Welp is an open-to-all online review platform that connects
					businesses and consumers together to build trust and
					collaboration. We’re free to use, open to everybody, and
					built on transparency.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					“Our platform” or “we” mean our reviews platform
					Welpstar.com, and any sub-domain, sub-directory, website or
					mobile app operated by us. Please read these “terms of use”
					or “terms” (If it was referred so) “Terms of use” or “terms”
					to understand what we expect from you – and also what you
					can expect from us. These terms refer to the following
					policies, guidelines and rules, which also apply to your use
					of our platform: Our Privacy Policy, which explains what
					data we collect when you use our platform and how this is
					used (see below for further information) Our Guidelines for
					Reviewers, which outline how you should (and shouldn’t) use
					our platform (see below for further information) Our
					policies, operating rules and codes published on our
					(“policies”) section(see below for further information)
					Whether you are using Welp for regular browse and search for
					businesses or reviews, or whether you want to submit a
					review yourself, then you’ll need to accept these terms so
					it’s clear what your legal rights and obligations are. Your
					access to, and use of, our platform is, at all times,
					conditional on you agreeing to these terms. So, if at any
					time you do not agree, or cannot comply, with these terms,
					you must not access or use our platform. Your use of our
					platform in any way, will be governed by these terms.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You agree to these terms by doing one or more of the
					following: (1) browsing, accessing, searching, writing a
					review, creating a post or otherwise using our platform; or
					(2) clicking a box or button, or providing any other kind of
					positive affirmation that you agree to these terms.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					Just so you know, words or expressions defined in “quotation
					marks” have the same meaning each time they are used in
					these terms. Joining and using Welp Below is an explanation
					of how to access and use our platform.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You and Welp: When we say “you” or “your”, we mean the
					person browsing, accessing, searching, writing a review, or
					otherwise using our platform. When we say “Welp”, “we”,
					“our” or “us”, we mean Welp entity that you contract with
					under these terms, which depends on where in the world you
					are accessing our platform from. See Our contracting
					entities and governing law section information on which Welp
					entity you are contracting with.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					Third-party products and services: We may use, present to
					you and/or link to third-party technology, products and/or
					services on our platform . We do not endorse or make any
					guarantee or promise, and do not assume any responsibility
					for any such third-party technology, products and/or
					services. We can’t guarantee that our platform will be
					compatible with your browser, network, or computer set-up.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					User account: In order to leave a review, create a
					post,comment on, like or flag a review and/or take any other
					action on our platform (except browsing), you must first
					create a user account. You are only permitted to create one
					user account. Your user account is personal to you ( We have
					the right to ask for identity verification) and must not be
					transferred to anyone else.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					In order to create a user account you will need to sign in
					to the platform using either your Facebook or Google
					account, or alternatively using your email address and the
					verification code which we will send to you. Sometimes your
					account will be automatically created and pre-filled with
					your name.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You will also be required to choose a username that will be
					displayed on the platform whenever you write a review,
					comment on a review or produce user generated content
					including any review, image or other content created by or
					originating from you on the platform (“user generated
					content”). Your username allows you to be identified by
					others. Remember that if you use your real name as your
					username, this could reveal your identity. Your username
					must not contain:
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					anything harmful, hateful, discriminatory, defamatory,
					obscene or illegal; the terms “Guest”, “Admin”, “.dk” or
					“.com” etc.; and characteristics belonging to someone else
					or a third party, such as the name of someone other than
					you.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You take full responsibility for controlling who accesses
					and uses your user account. For example:
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You should not allow any other person to access or use your
					user account and you should not share your login details,
					including your email address and verification code, with
					anyone else. If you suspect any of your user account login
					details have been stolen or misused inform us immediately by
					the contact page.
				</p>
				<p className="my-1">
					You should keep all information connected with your user
					account (including your email address) up to date and
					complete. If you would like to change your username, then
					you can do this yourself by logging into your user account.
					You’re responsible for all activity connected with your user
					account, including any reviews, posts, all comments and any
					user generated content. You may also choose to verify your
					identity by contacting us. During the verification process,
					you’ll be asked to select a photo ID, take a picture of your
					chosen ID and take a selfie. Your information is handled
					safely and securely, as explained in our Privacy Policy.
